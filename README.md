# Project 1: DATA ANALYSIS of Movie Ratings

Goal: Is there a conflict of interest for a website that both sells movie tickets and diplays review ratings?
Does a website like Fandango artificially display higher review ratings to sell more movie tickets?
Tasks Performed: Imported the data and read about the Background of the Data 
Explored Fandango Displayed Scores versus True User Ratings
Compared Fandango Ratings to Other Sites
