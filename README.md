# [Project 1: DATA ANALYSIS of Movie Ratings](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/fandango)

Goal: Is there a conflict of interest for a website that both sells movie tickets and diplays review ratings?
Does a website like Fandango artificially display higher review ratings to sell more movie tickets?
Tasks Performed: Imported the data and read about the Background of the Data 
Explored Fandango Displayed Scores versus True User Ratings
Compared Fandango Ratings to Other Sites
